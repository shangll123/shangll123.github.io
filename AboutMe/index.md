I obtained my PhD degree in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan in Aug 2023. I have been working with Prof. [Xiang Zhou](http://xzlab.org) on developing statistical methods for genetic and genomic datasets. My recent focus is on developing methods for analyzing spatial transcriptomics. I also work closely with Prof. [Jennifer Smith](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/smith-jennifer.html) in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan on large-scale quantitative trait mapping in African Americans in the GENOA study. Previously, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Biology from the Zhiyuan Honored College at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2012-2016).
